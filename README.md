# asra3Sala7ef
This is our first project, our mission was to create a website for an agency
of our own.
we choose to make an agency for volunteering abroad as we felt is an intersteing and an important idea.
in our home page, we did an introduction about the agency and what is does. we splited the work as following:
Nizar- was responsible for the home page.
muhammad- was responsible for south America continent.
Shoog- was responsible for Europe continent.
Hala- was responsible for Asia continent.

it was important to us to make a logo of our own (Turtles). As shown in the home page.
