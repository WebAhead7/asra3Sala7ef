    <p class="Volunteer before"> <strong><em>I stayed in Romania for two months with the Special Needs Support project.
          It’s hard to put my experience into words, but to start it was incredible, enlightening and life changing. The
          people I met, the staff and children I worked with - I’ll truly never forget them. Romania is a beautiful
          country and fairly undiscovered by hordes of tourists so it’s a lot of fun to travel around.
